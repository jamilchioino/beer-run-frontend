This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Make sure to download and run the backend for this project, found [here](https://github.com/jamilchioino/beer-run-backend)

Then, run the development server with:

```bash

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Env files pointing to the backend have been included for convenience

## Rationale
* The UI library shadcn was picked to make a placeholder UI.
* Prettier was picked for opinionated formatting, especially for consistent ordering of tailwind classes.
